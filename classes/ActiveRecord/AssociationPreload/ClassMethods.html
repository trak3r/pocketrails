<h2>Description</h2><fieldset><div class='row'><p>
Implements the details of eager loading of ActiveRecord associations.
Application developers should not use this module directly.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../Base.html">ActiveRecord::Base</a> is extended with this module.
The source code in <a href="../Base.html">ActiveRecord::Base</a> references
methods defined in this module.
</p>
<p>
Note that &#8216;eager loading&#8217; and &#8216;preloading&#8217; are
actually the same thing. However, there are two different eager loading
strategies.
</p>
<p>
The first one is by using table joins. This was only strategy available
prior to <a href="../../Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.1. Suppose that you have an
Author model with columns &#8216;name&#8217; and &#8216;age&#8217;, and a
Book model with columns &#8216;name&#8217; and &#8216;sales&#8217;. Using
this strategy, ActiveRecord would try to retrieve all data for an author
and all of its books via a single query:
</p>
<pre>
  SELECT * FROM authors
  LEFT OUTER JOIN books ON authors.id = books.id
  WHERE authors.name = 'Ken Akamatsu'
</pre>
<p>
However, this could result in many rows that contain redundant data. After
having received the first row, we already have enough data to instantiate
the Author object. In all subsequent rows, only the data for the joined
&#8216;books&#8217; table is useful; the joined &#8216;authors&#8217; data
is just redundant, and processing this redundant data takes memory and CPU
time. The problem quickly becomes worse and worse as the level of eager
loading increases (i.e. if ActiveRecord is to eager load the
associations&#8217; assocations as well).
</p>
<p>
The second strategy is to use multiple database queries, one for each level
of association. Since <a href="../../Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.1, this is the
default strategy. In situations where a table join is necessary (e.g. when
the +:conditions+ option references an association&#8216;s column), it will
fallback to the table join strategy.
</p>
<p>
See also <a
href="../Associations/ClassMethods.html">ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods</a>,
which explains eager loading in a more high-level (application
developer-friendly) manner.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<fieldset>
<div class="row">
<ul>
<li><a href="#M001782">preload_associations</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</fieldset>  






<h2>Protected Instance methods</h2>
<h2><a name="M001782">preload_associations</a> (records, associations, preload_options={})</h2>

<fieldset><div class='row'><p>
Eager loads the named associations for the given ActiveRecord record(s).
</p>
<p>
In this description, &#8216;association name&#8217; shall refer to the name
passed to an association creation method. For example, a model that
specifies <tt>belongs_to :author</tt>, <tt>has_many :buyers</tt> has
association names +:author+ and +:buyers+.
</p>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>
<tt>records</tt> is an array of <a
href="../Base.html">ActiveRecord::Base</a>. This array needs not be flat,
i.e. <tt>records</tt> itself may also contain arrays of records. In any
case, <tt><a href="ClassMethods.html#M001782">preload_associations</a></tt>
will preload the associations all records by flattening <tt>records</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<tt>associations</tt> specifies one or more associations that you want to
preload. It may be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a Symbol or a String which specifies a single association name. For
example, specifiying +:books+ allows this method to preload all books for
an Author.

</li>
<li>an Array which specifies multiple association names. This array is
processed recursively. For example, specifying <tt>[:avatar, :books]</tt>
allows this method to preload an author&#8216;s avatar as well as all of
his books.

</li>
<li>a Hash which specifies multiple association names, as well as association
names for the to-be-preloaded association objects. For example, specifying
<tt>{ :author =&gt; :avatar }</tt> will preload a book&#8216;s author, as
well as that author&#8216;s avatar.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
+:associations+ has the same format as the +:include+ option for <tt><a
href="../Base.html#M001842">ActiveRecord::Base.find</a></tt>. So
<tt>associations</tt> could look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  :books
  [ :books, :author ]
  { :author =&gt; :avatar }
  [ :books, { :author =&gt; :avatar } ]
</pre>
<p>
<tt>preload_options</tt> contains options that will be passed to
ActiveRecord#find (which is called under the hood for preloading records).
But it is passed only one level deep in the <tt>associations</tt> argument,
i.e. it&#8216;s not passed to the child associations when
<tt>associations</tt> is a Hash.
